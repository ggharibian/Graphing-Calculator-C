    Reflections:
            Despite many of the hardships thatplagued me this past week of my
            life, I am extremely proud of what I've done through this project. 
            This project encapsulates the majority of the topics that we've 
            studied throughout the past months and I'm happy of what I've 
            done overall. However, I also don't believe that this project was 
            my best work in this class. With the time I was able to allocate 
            towards this project, I was able to complete many of the esential 
           portions of the project but was not able to take the project
            further as I would've liked. I plan on updating this project  
            througout the next week and making it more advanced in any way 
            that I can. For now however, I hope that you enjoy the rest of 
            your semester professor Barkeshli! Thank you for always making 
            class during Covid cool. ;)
